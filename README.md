# WeatherWeather!!

This is a website that allows you to see the weather - in celsius or farenheit for the imperial system lovers - at anywhere in the world.
It's the Weather! Weather!.
There is no mobile styling, as this was done to showcase my usage of API's. My To Do List has better mobile styling!
Try it out! Thanks!

A website totally generated with JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Webpack, Date-FNS, OpenWeatherMap, and GIPHY API!
